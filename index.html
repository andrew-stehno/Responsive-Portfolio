                My name is Andrew Stehno.  I am currently a student at the University of Utah, enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
                The bootcamp is a high intensity, fast paced six month program covering front end and back end development.  At the conclusion of 
                this course, I look forward to utilizing my new skills, as well as some old ones, to be a part of and contribute to Utah's booming
                tech industry.    
            </p>

              Having grown up in the Mid-West, after relocating to Utah, I absoluty fell in love with the state.  My wife and I currently live in 
              South Jordan and keep busy with the vast amount of recreation available to us.  We enjoy hiking, sailing, offroading in our Jeep, and 
              working with our dogs.  To contact me, please visit the link above.
